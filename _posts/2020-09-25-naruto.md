Okay, I'm going to say it... Naturo was a bit of a dissapointment for me. I know people love it and see it as peak anime but it wasn't. Naruto for me could have been great but if you didnt watch it week by week waiting for the next episode than maybe you don't feel the same way I do. I didnt have the ability to know when the next episode was a filler or not unless I watched the end credit which I never do cause of spoilers. Naruto had wayyy to many fillers. Id rather they waot to come out with episodes than do 33 percent of their episodes. The worst part is fillers dont matter at all so why watch the episodes. Why dont people dock points on this show for doing this ?
